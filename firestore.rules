/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and role-based access control.
 * It assumes a user-centric data model where most data is owned by individual users.
 * Data validation is intentionally relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile data.
 * - `/user_wallets/{userId}`: Stores user's wallet information, secured by user ID.
 * - `/transactions/{transactionId}`: Logs crypto sales.
 * - `/rewards/{rewardId}`: Tracks user achievements and rewards.
 * - `/social_posts/{postId}`: Stores social media posts, readable by anyone, writable only by the author.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is private and accessible only to the owning user.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed to prevent enumeration.
 * - Social posts are publicly readable but writable only by the author.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `SocialPost` entity includes both `authorId` and `authorName`. The `authorId` is essential to validate
 *   that the user is authorized to update or delete the post. The author's name is also stored to avoid
 *   additional reads when displaying the post.
