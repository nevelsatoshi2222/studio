/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for PGC Platform
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 *  This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data
 *  while allowing controlled access to public content. It leverages Firebase
 *  Authentication to verify user identity and protect sensitive information.
 *  The rules are designed to prevent unauthorized data access and modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, secured by owner-only access.
 *  - /user_wallets/{userId}: Stores Solana wallet information, secured by owner-only access.
 *  - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction logs, write-protected and readable only by the associated user.
 *  - /rewards/{rewardId}: Stores reward history, write-protected and readable only by the associated user.
 *  - /social_posts/{postId}: Public posts. Any logged-in user can create a social post, and all logged-in users can read all posts. Posts can only be modified or deleted by the original author.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 *  - Data validation is minimal to allow for prototyping, but relational integrity is enforced.
 *  - Cloud Functions, with admin privileges, manage critical operations such as commission payouts and KYC verification.
 *  - The rules are designed to be auditable and maintainable through the use of helper functions.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` field is present in `user_wallets`, `transactions`, and `rewards` to enforce ownership without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Private user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, while public social posts are stored in the top-level `/social_posts` collection.
