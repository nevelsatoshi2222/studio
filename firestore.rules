/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and referral data,
 * restricts social posts to public read access with owner-only writes, and provides
 * role-based access control for admin functionalities. Data validation is relaxed for
 * rapid prototyping but critical authorization fields are validated.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/referrals/data: Stores referral data for each user.
 * - /social_posts/{postId}: Stores social media posts from all users.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Documents in this collection indicate admin status.
 * - /withdrawal_requests/{requestId}: Stores user withdrawal requests for admin processing.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile and referral data.
 * - Social posts are publicly readable, but only the owner can modify or delete them.
 * - Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent information harvesting.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `SocialPost` entity requires the `userId` field to match `request.auth.uid` on creation to ensure owner-only writes.
