/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control (RBAC) model, supplemented by user ownership for specific resources.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the user themselves can read/write their own profile.
 * - /social_posts/{postId}: Publicly readable collection of social media posts. Only the author can modify/delete their own posts.
 * - /withdrawal_requests/{requestId}: Stores withdrawal requests. Publicly readable but limited write access controlled by an admin role.
 * - /forums/{postId}: Publicly readable collection of governance forum posts. Only the author can modify/delete their own posts.
 * - /presale_purchases/{purchaseId}: Logs presale purchases. Publicly readable but limited write access controlled by an admin role.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles in the `/users` collection.
 * - Social media posts and forum posts are publicly readable, but write access is restricted to the author.
 * - Listing of users is not explicitly denied, but it's not enabled either; listing would require additional rules.
 * - Admin roles are not explicitly defined in this ruleset.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Social posts include `authorId` directly on the document to avoid needing to query a separate `/users/{userId}` document to verify ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - No explicit segregation is used (e.g., drafts vs. published), but the social media posts are separated into a top-level collection for public access.
